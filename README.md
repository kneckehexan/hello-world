# hello-world

Hello!
I'm originally a mechanical engineer but have always had a passion for computers. I have recently started taking a couple of university courses in basic programming (java, matlab, algorithms and data structures) and currently I'm exploring C in CS50x. I take any courses I can manage that seem interesting along side work and family and hope to develop enough knowledge in order to apply it in a proffessional environment!
